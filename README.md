# Source2Course - SourceParser

A library that provides functions to run code from one or more source files.

The goal is to not simply run a single file, but to combine functions from different
files or even packages.

One use case are exams or assignments from a programming course,
where students hand in solutions for tasks that are automatically parsed and tested.
The solutions may be extracted from source files to execute them in a different package,
or code may be generated so that tests can automatically assess solutions from different
packages.

This is mainly intended to be used with src2crs, but some features
may also be interesing for other purposes.
